# Oxford-Applied-Machine-Learning
This repository contains sample code I worked on for the class "Applied Machine Learning" at Oxford University, Hillary Term, 2021.

This includes using multiple supervised and unsupervised ML models, explainable AI via LIME and Shapley values, Bayesian optimization, and others.
